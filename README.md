Usage:

The project can be exercised by opening index.html found in a browser.  You can use the "Toggle Menu" link to show
and hide the menu when field of view is a concern on smaller devices.

Overview:

I used StreetView and the Yelp API (ajax) for places of interest.    Only one of my 5 points of interest, Vieira Park, yielded a Yelp review.  For points of interest that yielded a Yelp review I put the rating on the infowindow.   I also show the Yelp icon as the map marker.

I implemented the search functionality per requirements.  Clicking on any of the list links will have the same effect as clicking on the corresponding map marker.  I used all of my own photographs.   The pictures in the History section are from the plaques at Vieira Park, San Jose.


Acknowledgements:

As a suggestion from the first reviewer, I implemented the simple sidebar from David Miller. I used the link
http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/simple-sidebar/ to fork the repository found at
https://github.com/ironsummitmedia/startbootstrap-simple-sidebar.

I benefitted from a blog post by Marc Ridey on the use of markers.  The url for this post is http://blog.mridey.com/2010/11/maps-api-javascript-v3-multiple-markers_08.html.

I used the following url for text on my History page: http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAKX1_History_of_Vieira_Park_San_Jose_CA.

I made extensive use of the W3 Schools pages, the knockout.js documentation and the Bootstrap CSS documentation.

I spent a lot of time in the Google Map API docuemention trying to sort that out.
