============================

Usage:

The project can be exercised by opening index.html found in a browser.


Overview:

I used StreetView for places of interest.   I had planned on using the Yelp API but my neighborhood only yielded one review for my
places of interest.   Since I spent so much time getting Yelp to work, I included it by putting a "Communications Hill Area Reviews" section
beneath the navigation list.

I implemented the search functionality per requirements.  Clicking on any of the list links will have the same effect as clicking on the corresponing
map marker.   That is, a Google StreetView Panorama window will be opened.

I used all of my own photographs.   The pictures in the History section are from the plaques at Vieira Park, San Jose.


Acknowledgments:

I benefitted from a blog post by Marc Ridey on the use of markers.  The url for this post is http://blog.mridey.com/2010/11/maps-api-javascript-v3-multiple-markers_08.html.

I used the following url for text on my History page: http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMAKX1_History_of_Vieira_Park_San_Jose_CA.

I made extensive use of the W3 Schools pages, the knockout.js documentation and the Bootstrap CSS documentation.

As you might expect, I spent a lot of time in the Google Map API docuemention trying to sort that out.
